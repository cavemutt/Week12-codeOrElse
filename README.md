# Week12-codeOrElse
codeOrElse.com is a coding bootcamp unlike any others...

codeOrElse is a coding bootcamp unlike any other, with methods that might just walk the edge... (This is a parody website, any resemblance to something real would be scary.)

I've re-purr-posed a few previous projects, using the website pages from week 9 (Bootstrap) and Baz Jackson Wachowski's watchful eyes from week 10, and added the current requirement of having a working CRUD app using AJAX with jquery. I've used a combo of Bootstrap 5, regular comfy CSS, Jquery and good 'ol vanilla JavaScript. I am very glad to have this experience with Bootstrap and jquery, but I still prefer the control and possibilities of the vanillas. 

You can find CRUD on the sign-up page, using the json server to access the db.json file. You can READ all the members in the table at the bottom (it updates on any additions/changes). Enter your info into the form, hit the submit button, and your info will CREATE a row in the table (and the db.json file). Each row in the table populates a delete and update button. Delete will DELETE the row you hit delete on. The UPDATE will 1) populate the form with the row's info, 2) bring you to the form section, 3) change the text of the title and submit button, 4) allow you to change any of the info, and 5) when you hit the update info button, it updates the info in the db file and the table, and the text restores to it's original text. The form fields will clear out whenever something is submitted/changed. 

It's all fake, the password field is just text to make it easier, and unlike my Week10 project, it does not magically know your ip address, location and current weather. (shameless plug for someone to look at the Week10 project...) 

I hope you enjoy it!
